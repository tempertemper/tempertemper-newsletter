# ðŸ¥³ Happy new year! Decemberâ€™s roundup

As 2021 draws to a close, there's just enough time to put together your monthly roundup of the articles from my blog:

1. [Design for everyone](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/design-for-everyone)
2. [Safari 15â€™s Tab Groups](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/safari-15s-tab-groups)


## From the archives

I don't use images very much on my website, but I'm currently writing an article which includes some screenshots, and I found myself referencing a post I wrote earlier this year on [optimising images for the web](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/converting-images-to-avif-in-2021).

The benefit of using WebP and/or AVIF over PNG and JPEG is particularly obvious when you consider that one of the images I'm using went from a 167KB (kilobyte) PNG to a 18KB WebP and a 10KB AVIF!
