# ðŸ˜³ Quite the month! â€“ Septemberâ€™s roundup from tempertemper

September has been quite the month here in the UK; we've seen the death of a monarch, yet another new Government, and of course there's been the annual rush for pumpkin spice lattes! But rest assured amidst the chaos I wrote a couple of articles for you:

1. [Focus appearance explained](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-appearance-explained)
2. [Itâ€™s good to make mistakes](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/its-good-to-make-mistakes)


## From the archives

A couple of days after I published 'Focus appearance explained', the draft for version 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) was updated. I tweaked my just-published article in line with the updated guidance, and also revised February's 
[WCAG 2.2 in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-2-2-in-language-i-can-understand). Worth a re-read!

## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during September:
