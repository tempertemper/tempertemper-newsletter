# 🎅 Festive fun – December’s roundup from tempertemper

The festive period is nearly over and, like me, I hope you’ve eaten your body weight in rich food and chocolate. Still a day or two to eat, drink, and be merry, so I’ll be quick! Here’s your final roundup for 2023; this time I wrote you an article about [screen reader users and the tab key](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/screen-reader-users-and-the-tab-key).


## From the archives

Something I constantly advise designers and developers to avoid is [overlapping interactive areas](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/overlapping-interactive-areas), where an interactive item like a button sits on top of another interactive item (often a table row). Don’t do it, people!


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during December:

- [The EU has officially stated that accessibility ‘overlays’ are bad!](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners/europa-web-guide/design-content-and-development/accessibility/testing-early-and-regularly/accessibility-overlays_en)
- [The Lost Voice](https://youtu.be/ra9I0HScTDw?si=rvI8RSVz6MAAvIRb), a short film from Apple on their new Personal Voice feature
- [Why carousels don’t work](https://www.antonsten.com/why-carousels-dont-work)
- [6 Reasons Why Accessibility is Maintained, Not Attained](https://accessicart.com/6-reasons-why-accessibility-is-maintained-not-attained/)
- [Autocomplete accessibility bookmarklet](https://racheleditullio.com/blog/2023/11/autocomplete-accessibility-bookmarklet/)

Anyway, have a great Hogmanay and I’ll catch you at the end of January 🥳🍹
