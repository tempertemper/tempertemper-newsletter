# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cycle season ‚Äì June's roundup

After working from home for more than two years, I've been enjoying the odd trip to the office recently. It's 15 kilometres away, which is a nice distance to cycle, so I've bought myself a bike! Coincidentally, the Tour de France begins tomorrow, but I don't think I'm quite ready for that yet!

As well as thinking about bikes, I've written five articles for you over the course of the month:

1. [WWDC 2022 roundup](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wwdc-2022-roundup)
2. [What I wish was in WCAG: prohibit icon-only buttons](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/what-i-wish-was-in-wcag-prohibit-icon-only-buttons)
3. [Icon-only links fail WCAG](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/icon-only-links-fail-wcag)
4. [Accessibility doesn't stop at WCAG compliance](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessibility-doesnt-stop-at-wcag-compliance)
5. [Accessible animation without the compromise](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessible-animation-without-the-compromise)


## From the archives

Almost exactly a year ago, I wrote about [using the Increased Contrast Mode CSS media query](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-the-increased-contrast-mode-css-media-query), and at that time it was only available in Safari Technology Preview. The other day I had a look at browser support and it currently stands at a whopping 84.5%!

Not only is this great news for a more accessible web, but it shows how quickly new CSS features can gain widespread support these days; no more waiting for nearly a decade for enough people to update their browsers so we can use the latest and greatest features!


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles from around the web that I read during June:

- [Let‚Äôs make accessibility boring again](https://medium.com/kinandcartacreated/lets-make-accessibility-boring-again-ed4b8da66128): "Boring is not our enemy. Boring is good ‚Ä¶ Boring should beat beautiful, if beautiful blocks access"
- [Writing Useful Alt Text](https://css-irl.info/writing-useful-alt-text/)
- [An interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook](https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1534174228035026944); my favourite bit is around the 21 minute mark where he talks about how accessibility is not an afterthought
- [WCAG's Resize Text and Reflow; how they work together, and how to test that they‚Äôre compliant](https://yatil.net/blog/resize-text-reflow)
- [An excellent Twitter thread on some commonly held but incorrect assumptions about screen reader users](https://twitter.com/jessbudd4/status/1537620188324978688)

Anyway, I'm off to collect my bike from the shop. See you again at the end of July! üö≤
