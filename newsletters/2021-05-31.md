# ‚òîÔ∏è Precipitation and productivity ‚Äì May‚Äôs roundup

May was very wet here in the UK. But staying indoors meant I wrote plenty of blog posts! I started by continuing to look at `git restore`, shifted my attention to image compression and performance, and finished up with a dive into how to make tables responsive *and* accessible.

## From the archives

One of the highlights of my year is coming up on the 7th of June: Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).

I‚Äôve [written a fair bit about Apple](https://www.tempertemper.net/category/apple) over the years, and something I enjoy is posting [a roundup of the things I find most interesting at WWDC](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wwdc-2020-roundup), so expect one in next month‚Äôs newsletter!

I also tend to do a bit of live tweeting during the event so feel free to [follow me over on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempertemper) if you want to join in.


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting nuggets from around the web that I enjoyed during May:

- [Designing Custom Focus Indicators](https://craftcms.com/accessibility/designing-custom-focus-indicators)
- [GOV.UK Frontend v3.12.0 makes links easier to identify and more legible](https://twitter.com/timpaul/status/1392880421663293440)
- [WCAG 2.2 has reached ‚Äòwide review‚Äô stage, meaning it‚Äôll be the recommendation soon](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/)
- [Apple previews powerful software updates designed for people with disabilities](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/)

Anyway, enjoy WWDC if that‚Äôs your thing (maybe I'll catch you on the tweets?), and I‚Äôll see you again this time next month ü§ìÔ£ø
