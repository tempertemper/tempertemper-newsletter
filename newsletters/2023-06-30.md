# 🍎 WWDC excitement – June’s roundup from tempertemper

On the 5th of this month Apple held their World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) and it’s an event I look forward to watching every year. This year was a bit special due to their announcement of Apple Vision Pro but, weirdly, I was probably more excited about a handful of relatively small software updates, so I wrote about them in my [WWDC 2023 roundup](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wwdc-2023-roundup).


## From the archives

I was part of a group chat at work about the use of emojis; the conversation included how support for newer emojis can’t be guaranteed, so they should be used with caution. It reminded me of a couple of posts I wrote last year about something similar, where certain HTML elements aren’t read out by screen reader software, meaning we can’t rely on them.

First up was [Bold and italics aren’t read by screen readers](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/bold-and-italics-arent-read-by-screen-readers), and I followed it up with [Be careful with strikethrough](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/be-careful-with-strikethrough).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during June:

- [Accessibility isn’t new — and neither is ableism](https://mawconsultingllc.wordpress.com/2021/09/27/accessibility-isnt-new-and-neither-is-ableism/)
- [The problem with automatically focusing the first input and what to do instead](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-automatically-focusing-the-first-input-and-what-to-do-instead/)
- [Accessible Numbers – Presenting numbers and data clearly](https://accessiblenumbers.com)
- [Inclusive Design: designing with everyone in mind](https://wearesnook.com/inclusive-design-designing-with-everyone-in-mind/)
- [Beyond WCAG: Losing Spoons Online](https://www.tpgi.com/beyond-wcag-losing-spoons-online/)

Anyway, I’ll catch you again at the end of July! 👋
