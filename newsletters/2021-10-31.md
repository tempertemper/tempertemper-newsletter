# üëª Boo! October's roundup

It's Halloween, I've just been [guising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-or-treating#Guising) with the kids, and they were given more chocolates and sweeties than they'll ever manage to eat! If I could give you a handful I would, but that's not all that easy over the internet so here's something I *can* share; my blog posts from the last month:

1. [Always style links with a pseudo-class](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/always-style-links-with-a-pseudo-class)
2. [Face ID on the Mac won‚Äôt happen](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/face-id-on-the-mac-wont-happen)
3. [Mac event 2021](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/mac-event-2021)
4. [If HTML and ARIA don‚Äôt allow it, it‚Äôs probably a bad idea](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-html-and-aria-dont-allow-it-its-probably-a-bad-idea)


## From the archives

I've had some really interesting conversations with colleagues this month about links that don't open in the same browser tab. The advice I've been giving is the same that I blogged about this time last year in [Opening links in a new tab or window is better avoided](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/opening-links-in-a-new-tab-or-window-is-better-avoided).


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting bits and bobs from around the web, mostly new and one oldie, that I enjoyed during the month of October:

- [Understanding Logical Focus Order](https://devyarns.com/logical-focus-order/)
- [Emoji overuse, and why inaccessible content is not screen reader software's fault](https://adrianroselli.com/2021/10/blaming-screen-readers-red-flag.html)
- [Buttons vs. Links; No, they are not the same](https://yatil.net/blog/buttons-vs-links)
- ["User research isn't about finding out what users like, but what works best for them"](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/18/why-we-care-more-about-effectiveness-than-efficiency-or-satisfaction/)
- [How remote work is removing barriers for some disabled people starting new jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/legally-blind-low-vision-how-remote-work-changed-career-2021-9?r=US&IR=T)
- [An article about ARIA attributes and why they‚Äôre often unnecessary](https://www.scottohara.me//blog/2021/10/04/redundantly-redundant.html)

Anyway, I'm off to work out what to do with all of that Halloween candy‚Ä¶ üòè&#x2060;üç´ See you at the end of November!
