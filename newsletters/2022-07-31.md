# ‚òÄÔ∏è Scorchio! ‚Äì July's roundup from tempertemper

After a month with the hottest temperatures ever recorded here in the UK, normal weather has thankfully resumed. Me? Despite the blistering heat, I've made good use of [my new bike](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1546555003560771585) and even wrote two articles for you:

1. [Bag some AAA wins where you can](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/bag-some-aaa-wins-where-you-can)
2. [Abbreviations can be problematic](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/abbreviations-can-be-problematic)


## From the archives

I've been doing a lot of digging through the HTML and ARIA specifications in the last couple of weeks. Following the specs is almost always the right way to go, but there are some strong arguments for breaking the rules in some situations. Here's something I wrote a while back about one such case where it's not all that simple: [If HTML and ARIA don‚Äôt allow it, it‚Äôs probably a bad idea](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-html-and-aria-dont-allow-it-its-probably-a-bad-idea). 


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during July:

- [text-overflow: ellipsis considered harmful](https://yatil.net/blog/text-overflow-ellipsis-harmful)
- [Are you sure that‚Äôs a number input?](https://kilianvalkhof.com/2022/css-html/are-you-sure-thats-a-number-input/)
- [What is alternative text? How do I write it for images, charts, and graphs?](https://matthewdeeprose.github.io/alt-text-images-charts-graphs)
- [When animation is an accessibility problem](https://www.theverge.com/23191768/animation-accessibility-neurodivergence)
- [Subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines in HTML](https://www.tpgi.com/subheadings-subtitles-alternative-titles-and-taglines-in-html/)

Anyway, I hope the weather in August proves a bit more sensible. See you this time next month! üå¶
