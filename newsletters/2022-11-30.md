# ‚öΩÔ∏è Winter World Cup ‚Äì November‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

Being a Scotsman, I'm not a big fan of international football üòÖ But I do enjoy catching the odd match when the World Cup's on; in between watching Spain, Brazil, Australia, and the rest, and I've written a couple of blog posts for you:

1. [Buttons with icons and text](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/buttons-with-icons-and-text)
2. [Which images need descriptive text?](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/which-images-need-descriptive-text)


## From the archives

One for the coders among you, I was talking to someone last week about why I still use a lot of XHTML syntax when writing modern HTML (HTML5), so I thought I'd remind you why I think [XHTML syntax is still worth using](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/xhtml-syntax-is-still-worth-using).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during November:

- [iOS 16.2 to introduce 'Custom Accessibility Mode' with streamlined experience for iPhone and iPad](https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/08/ios-16-2-custom-accessibility-mode/)
- [3 Ways We Fail to Take Accessibility Seriously](https://css-tricks.com/why-dont-developers-take-accessibility-seriously/)

- [Twitter‚Äôs Layoffs Are a Blow to Accessibility](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-layoffs-accessibility/)

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the rest of the World Cup, and have a relaxing Christmas break. See you again at the end of December for the last newsletter of 2022! üéÑ
