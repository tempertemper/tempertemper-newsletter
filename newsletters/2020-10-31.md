# Halloween‚Äôs here üéÉüçÇ ‚Äì October‚Äôs roundup

Boo! üëª

It was a productive start to October, with five posts in the first fortnight. Then one of my kids caught a cold and wasn't sleeping well, so my early starts (and therefore my writing) took a bit of a knock.

1. [Using the keyboard to navigate on macOS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-the-keyboard-to-navigate-on-macos)
2. [How to use the keyboard to navigate on Safari](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-to-use-the-keyboard-to-navigate-on-safari)
3. [Styling list markers the right way](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/styling-list-markers-the-right-way)
4. [Custom unordered list markers, done right](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/custom-unordered-list-markers-done-right)
5. [Accessibility issues when removing list markers](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessibility-issues-when-removing-list-markers)
6. [Respecting people‚Äôs privacy](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/respecting-peoples-privacy)


## Updated articles

I updated a few older posts during October:

- I set up a new Mac and realised my [Using nvm on macOS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-nvm-on-macos) article needed a wee bit of extra detail
- Following some feedback on Twitter, I've updated my article on [opening links in a new tab/window](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/opening-links-in-a-new-tab-or-window-is-better-avoided) to include details on some browsers that offer special Back button behaviour for links that open in a new tab/window


## Elsewhere on the web

- [End the awkward](https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/end-the-awkward/) ‚Äì an enlightening article from Scope on language to use and avoid when talking about disability
- [Accessible Web Animation](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-web-animation-the-wcag-on-animation-explained/) where Val Head explains how animation can be accessible
- [Writing even more CSS with Accessibility in Mind, Part 2: Respecting user preferences](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/writing-even-more-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-user-preferences/)
- [People Problems](https://css-tricks.com/people-problems/) by Robin Rendle on CSS-Tricks, talking about cultural change being more important than nitty-gritty code or user experience improvements
- [Heading off confusion: When do headings fail WCAG?](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2020/03/heading-off-confusion-when-do-headings-fail-wcag/), which describes some heading anti-patterns that might not fail WCAG, but are very bad for users

Anyway, I hope you manage to have a fun Halloween and I'll see you again this time next month! ü¶á
