# 👧🏻👦🏼 School's out! – July’s roundup from tempertemper

The school summer holidays are upon us! Our kids have been off for just over a week and, as a result of careful routine planning and some tactical days off work, it's going okay. Amidst the disruption, I've still been writing; here's the one I hit 'publish' on: [Accessibility represents maturity](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessibility-represents-maturity).


## Updated

[WCAG 2.2 was moved to ‘Proposed Recommendation’](https://www.w3.org/news/2023/web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag-2-2-is-a-w3c-proposed-recommendation/) on the 20th of July and a fair amount changed since their last 'Candidate recommendation' in May. As a result, I've updated my two articles that cover version 2.2:

- [WCAG 2.2 in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-2-2-in-language-i-can-understand)
- [https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-appearance-explained](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-appearance-explained)


## From the archives

I'm currently chipping away at six or seven draft blog posts, and in one I wanted to talk about how HTML can be pretty much accessible by default and it's us that breaks it with convoluted CSS. I ended up removing the point, but had linked to this article from my archives, which I reckon is worth re-sharing: [HTML isn’t quite accessible out of the box](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/html-isnt-quite-accessible-out-of-the-box).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during July:

- [Creating a dyslexia friendly workplace](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide)
- [Design is compromise](https://stephanango.com/design-is-compromise)
- [There’s no such thing as a “normal” user](https://karlgroves.com/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-normal-user/)
- [How to Write Good Labels](https://jarango.com/2023/07/10/how-to-write-good-labels/)
- [Toggles suck!](https://axesslab.com/toggles-suck/)

Anyway, I’ll catch you again at the end of next month, and hopefully the rest of the school break goes as well as this first week has; wish me luck! 😅
