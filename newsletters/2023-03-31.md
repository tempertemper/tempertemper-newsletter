# üå•Ô∏è Winter is over - March‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

It's finally feeling a bit warmer after what has felt like a long winter. Funnily enough, this month's articles come with the two longest titles in my back catalog!

1. [Windows high contrast mode and focus outlines or: My focus indicators were inaccessible](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/windows-high-contrast-mode-and-focus-outlines)
2. [The difference between Increased Contrast Mode and Windows High Contrast Mode (Forced Colours Mode)](The difference between Increased Contrast Mode and Windows High Contrast Mode (Forced Colours Mode))


## From the archives

During the writing of the two articles this month I got to thinking about how inconsistent, buggy, or limited browser support for CSS features can have a big impact on accessibility. I've written a lot of articles over the years, and as soon as I started drafting something I realised I'd already covered the topic!

My post covers the `<select>` element but the principle also applies to the `box-shadow` workaround for Safari's `outline` issues I wrote about in March's first article: [Form styling limitations are an accessibility issue](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/form-styling-limitations-are-an-accessibility-issue).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during March:

- [WebKit Features in Safari 16.4](https://webkit.org/blog/13966/webkit-features-in-safari-16-4/)
- [Why Motion on Websites and Digital Content Is a Problem](https://equalentry.com/why-motion-on-websites-and-digital-content-is-a-problem/)
- [A beginner's guide to manual accessibility testing](https://blog.pope.tech/2023/03/01/a-beginners-guide-to-manual-accessibility-testing/)
- [Setting up a screen reader testing environment on your computer](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/)
- [Accessible but never boring](https://wise.design/design-at-wise/stories/accessible-but-never-boring)

Anyway, here's to the warmer weather, and I'll see you again at the end of April üå∑
