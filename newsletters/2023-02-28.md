# üëÄ Blink and you‚Äôll miss it! - February‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

It never fails to surprise me how quickly February draws to a close. I had a week's holiday, which made it feel even shorter than normal, but I still managed to write a couple of articles for you!

1. [Buttons, links, and focus](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/buttons-links-and-focus)
2. [If you‚Äôre going to do a job, do it properly](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-youre-going-to-do-a-job-do-it-properly)


## From the archives

I sometimes have to remind myself that covering the basics is never a waste of time. There's always someone who will be hearing it for the first time, and for the rest it's a good reminder. I wrote about this a year or so ago: [The curse of knowledge](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-curse-of-knowledge).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during February:

- [Pushing Interop Forward in 2023](https://webkit.org/blog/13706/interop-2023/)
- [11 Secrets of LEGO Designers](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/643993/lego-designers-job-secrets), my favourite points being around designing with heavy constrains (colour palettes), and almost always with already-existing bricks (components)
- [The Iconfactory Co-Founder Gedeon Maheux Talks Accessibility On Twitter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2023/01/25/the-iconfactory-co-founder-gedeon-maheux-talks-accessibility-on-twitter-the-blow-of-losing-twitterrific-in-new-interview/)
- [What a switch control is and how they work](https://youtu.be/V1yoOLhx_qA)
- [Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/)

Anyway, March is a normal-length month, so there's plenty of time to write some more blog posts before I catch you again on the 31st ‚úçÔ∏è
