# ðŸ’¡ One Thing â€“ Aprilâ€™s roundup

May is nearly upon us, and on the 19th it's [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://accessibility.day) (or GAAD). I have a challenge for you! Take some time to do <i>one thing</i> to make the world a wee bit more accessible:

- Use your keyboard alone for your normal workflow for 15 minutes
- Finally take some time to [learn how to use a screen reader](https://speckyboy.com/testing-your-website-screen-reader/)
- Talk to someone you know who has a disability about the digital barriers they face regularly
- Run [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) on your website to find out what accessibility issues you have

In return for your effort, I've written you some articles:

1. [If one person is remote, everyone should be remote](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-one-person-is-remote-everyone-should-be-remote)
2. [Upgrading from iPhone XS to 13 Mini](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/upgrading-from-iphone-xs-to-13-mini)
3. [CSS Naked Day](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/css-naked-day)
4. [HTML isnâ€™t quite accessible out of the box](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/html-isnt-quite-accessible-out-of-the-box)
5. [I deleted 1Password](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/i-deleted-1password)


## From the archives

On CSS Naked Day, when I removed all styling from my website, someone I spoke to was surprised that it still had a dark theme. This was because they were using Dark Mode on their device, and [HTML can check for Dark/Light Mode settings](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/html-only-dark-mode); no styling necessary!

Since writing the article last summer, Firefox has added support, so around 90% of all web browsers now support HTML-only Dark Mode.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles from around the web that I read during April:

- [WebAIM Million report for 2022](https://webaim.org/blog/webaim-million-2022/)
- [Accessible Typefaces, Fonts, and Text](https://youtu.be/K6l6FwMChvI?t=502)

- [Common accessibility issues that you can fix today](https://hidde.blog/common-a11y-issues/)
- [Twitter exposes '+ALT' button on images](https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1512191972856975364)

Anyway, good luck with your GAAD challenge and I'd love to hear what you do between now and the 19th of May: [let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempertemper)! See you again this time next month ðŸš€
