# ‚úàÔ∏è Summer holidays ‚Äì August‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

August brought with it a very welcome break with the family in Spain. I took a short break from writing about accessibility too, and instead wrote a couple of articles about social networks:

## From the archives

It feels like more and more companies are encouraging people to get back to the office at the moment, which is creating a bit of an imbalance in meetings. For a very long time, everyone was dialling in separately from their homes, which wasn't the same as meeting in person but at least we were all on equal footing. I often remind myself of an article I wrote last year: [If one person is remote, everyone should be remote](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-one-person-is-remote-everyone-should-be-remote).

## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during August:

- [Where to Put Focus When Deleting a Thing](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/08/where-to-put-focus-when-deleting-a-thing.html)
- [European Accessibility Act: What you need to know](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/european-accessibility-act-what-you-need-to-know/)
- [How to document the screen reader user experience](https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/guides/screen-reader-ux.html)
- [Toggles suck!](https://axesslab.com/toggles-suck/)
- [Lego to sell bricks coded with braille to help vision-impaired children read](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/24/lego-to-sell-bricks-coded-with-braille-to-help-vision-impaired-children-read)

Anyway, I‚Äôll catch you again at the end of September; in the mean time, it's back to work! üë®‚Äçüíª
