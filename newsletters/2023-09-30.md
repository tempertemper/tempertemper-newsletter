# üéÇ Life gets in the way ‚Äì September‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

September is my favourite month of year; the days feel just the right length, the weather's still decent, and it contains my birthday! I've been so busy with family stuff the past few days that I missed my last-day-of-the-month publishing deadline! I wrote one article for you during September, and I think I've now expressed all my thoughts surrounding Twitter: [Own your own content](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/own-your-own-content).


## From the archives

I enjoy being proved wrong. A while back I published an article on why I think [Icon-only links fail WCAG](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/icon-only-links-fail-wcag). I've sometimes wondered about the "except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general" [caveat the Web Content Accessibility Guildelines offer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#link-purpose-in-context), but I'm not convinced this covers the use of icons on their own. So I thought I'd re-raise the subject here in case anyone else has an interesting take on icon-only links; [I'd love to hear from you](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during September:

- [Quick and very dirty target size checker](https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2023/08/28/quick-and-very-dirty-target-size-checker/)
- [What Are Accessibility Overlays?](https://briefs.video/videos/what-are-accessibility-overlays/)
- [What makes an accessible date picker? Is it even possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Gy2WN4Iys&amp;t=128s)
- [Dialogs and popovers seem similar. How are they different?](https://hidde.blog/dialog-modal-popover-differences/)
- [The five types of people who produce inaccessible code](https://ericwbailey.website/published/the-five-types-of-people-who-produce-inaccessible-code/)

Anyway, the birthday celebrations are over and my writing has turned back to accessibility, so I'll catch you again at the end of October with updates on those ‚úçÔ∏è
