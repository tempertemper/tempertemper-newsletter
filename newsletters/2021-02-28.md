# ‚õÑÔ∏è What a cold February that was! ‚Äì tempertemper Newsletter

As lockdown continued for most of us, we've also weathered what felt like the coldest February for a long time; those two things together means I've been doing a lot of writing!

## From the archives

I was listening to a non-techy podcast the other day where the person being interviewed mentioned how easy HTML is to learn: you can get going with it in an hour or two. His point was that you shouldn't be scared of it, which is absolutely true.

But that doesn't mean HTML is easy, in fact [HTML can get surprisingly complicated](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/html-is-more-complicated-than-you-think); since it's the language *everything* on the web is output in, it should be approached with respect.


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some great articles from around the web that I read (or re-read) this month:

- [CSS is finally getting container queries](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5796)
- [The first draft of WCAG 3.0 has been published](https://jspellman-77432.medium.com/an-insider-look-at-wcag-3-0-276e9b964a33)
- [An animation that beautifully explains the social model of disability](https://youtu.be/9s3NZaLhcc4)
- [A reminder not to use `type="number"` on the `input` element](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)

Anyway, here's hoping the sun we've had over the last couple of days continues well into March, and I'll see you again on the 31st üëã
