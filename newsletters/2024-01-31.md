# ✅ New Year’s resolutions – January’s roundup from tempertemper

Happy New Year! I’m settling into 2024 nicely and, after the indulgences over the festive period, am nicely back on track with good habits like daily exercise, and resisting bad habits like chocolate biscuits with my cup of tea! As ever, I've published to my blog for you; this time around [the accessibility conversations you want to be having](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-accessibility-conversations-you-want-to-be-having). Enjoy!


## From the archives

Writing good descriptive (or ‘alt’) text for images is hard. But what if you don’t need alt text at all? This article I wrote on [which images need descriptive text](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/which-images-need-descriptive-text) is worth a read.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during January:

- [What every leader must know about 2023’s accessibility lawsuits](https://inklusiv.ca/what-every-leader-must-know-about-2023s-accessibility-lawsuits/)
- [Stop trying to recruit unicorns with acorns](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/stop-trying-to-recruit-unicorns-with-acorns/)
- [An autocomplete accessibility bookmarklet](https://racheleditullio.com/blog/2023/11/autocomplete-accessibility-bookmarklet/)
- [Apple Podcasts Is Getting Transcripts—The Accessibility Ramifications Are Immense](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2024/01/29/apple-podcasts-is-getting-transcripts-the-accessibility-ramifications-are-immense/)
- [axe-con 2024](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/schedule/) is on the 20th to 22nd of February

Anyway, I hope your New Year’s resolutions are going well, and I’ll see you again at the end of February 🥗🏃‍♂️
