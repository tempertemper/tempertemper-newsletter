# ðŸ¥ž Pancakes and posts â€“ February's roundup

Every morning, I wake up nice and early to work on my blog before the kids surface, but tomorrow is pancake day so I'll be using a bit of that writing time to prepare breakfast instead! Over February, though, there weren't any pancakes to distract me, so I wrote you three posts:

1. [Going all-in on iCloud Passwords](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/going-all-in-on-icloud-passwords)
2. [Safari, focus-visible and accessibility](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/safari-focus-visible-and-accessibility)
3. [WCAG 2.2 in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-2-2-in-language-i-can-understand) (a follow-up to last month's [WCAG, but in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand))


## From the archives

I had a few chats about disabled buttons over the course of the month, which reminded me of an article I wrote a few years ago on [how to avoid disabled buttons](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-to-avoid-disabled-buttons). I also referenced a couple of excellent articles by other people, so I'll share them here:

- [Disabled buttons suck](https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/)
- [Frustrating design patterns: disabled buttons](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/frustrating-design-patterns-disabled-buttons/)


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles from around the web, some old, some new, that I read in February:

- [The social model: do we disable people through our tech?](https://www.getstark.co/blog/the-social-model-do-we-disable-people-through-our-tech)
- [Introducing the dialog element](https://webkit.org/blog/12209/introducing-the-dialog-element/)
- [Using the language attribute to make your website accessible](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/using-the-language-attribute-to-make-your-website-accessible)
- ['Access', a short documentary about accessibility and universal design](https://vimeo.com/higginsvideo/accessmovie)
- [4 reasons why businesses should care about disability issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewpulrang/2022/02/21/4-reasons-why-businesses-should-care-about-disability-issues)

Anyway, I hope you manage to enjoy a few pancakes tomorrow morning too! Catch you again at the end of March ðŸ˜‹
