# 🏳️‍🌈 Inclusivity and HTML – May's roundup

It's June tomorrow, which means the beginning of Pride Month; a time to celebrate how far we've come with civil rights, but a reminder that we still have a long way to go. Not Pride related, but definitely about inclusivity, here are the articles I wrote for you in May:

1. [Sometimes when it’s false, it’s true](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/sometimes-when-its-false-its-true)
2. [Booleans in ARIA](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/booleans-in-aria)
3. [XHTML syntax is still worth using](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/xhtml-syntax-is-still-worth-using)


## From the archives

HTML is great. ARIA can be handy too. But it bears repeating that semantic HTML does almost all the accessibility heavy lifting without a single ARIA attribute or line of JavaScript. Last year, I wrote about the case of a bunch of [unnecessary code being used on a `href`-less `<a>` element](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/links-missing-href-attributes-and-over-engineered-code), where just adding the `href` attribute would have done all that work automatically.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles from around the web that I read during May:

- [Additional “assistance”](https://htmhell.dev/31-additional-assistance/), where it's explained how, with the best intentions, we can overcomplicate simple things for the benefit of pretty much nobody
- [Please, stop disabling zoom](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/please-stop-disabling-zoom/) – friends don’t let friends disable pinch-to-zoom on their websites!
- [Toilets](https://finnberrys.co.uk/Blog/blog-05-toilets.html) – a really good example of when well intentioned but under-informed able people design for disabled people
- [Divs are bad!](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/divs-are-bad/) – The `<div>` element has no semantic meaning, but that doesn’t mean it can be used just any old place
- [A preview of new accessibility features coming from Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/apple-previews-innovative-accessibility-features/)

Anyway, I hope you manage to get out and join your local Pride celebrations! See you again at the end of June 🌈
