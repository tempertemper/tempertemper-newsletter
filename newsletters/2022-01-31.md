# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Working off those festive calories ‚Äì January‚Äôs roundup

I don't know about you, but I enjoy a wee bit of indulgence over the festive period: chocolate, good food, a few drinks with family and friends. But I've been back on the straight and narrow this month, including my longest streak of runs to date (15 days in a row). I've also written a few blog posts:

1. [Apple Watch‚Äôs default app view is bad](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/apple-watchs-default-app-view-is-bad)
2. [The curse of knowledge](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-curse-of-knowledge)
3. [WCAG, but in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand)


## From the archives

I really enjoyed a recent post by Jeremy Keith on [adding conditional 'Back' links via the `@display-mode` media query](https://adactio.com/journal/18762); it reminded me of an article I wrote last summer on the [challenges faced when implementing of website-based back links](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-trouble-with-back-links).


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting titbits from around the web, old and new, that I enjoyed during January:

- [Accessibility Lipstick on a Usability Pig](https://webaim.org/blog/accessibility-lipstick-on-a-usability-pig/)
- [How-to: Accessible heading structure](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-accessible-heading-structure/)
- [Dyslexic Myths Presented as Truths](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dyslexic-myths-presented-truths-gareth-ford-williams/)
- [Labelling the point: Scenarios of label misuse in WCAG](https://www.tpgi.com/labeling-the-point-scenarios-of-label-misuse-in-wcag/)
- [Quick accessibility tests anyone can do](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/01/18/quick-accessibility-tests-anyone-can-do/)
- [More to give than just the `div`: semantics and how to get them right](https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2022-01-23-more-to-give-than-just-the-div-semantics-and-how-to-get-them-right)

Anyway, I hope your 2022 has gotten off to a solid start too. I think I'll maybe give my running trainers a few days' rest, and I'll catch you again at the end of February! üëüüëü
