# ðŸ“£ Talking the talk â€“ September's roundup

During September, a couple of presentations I gave went live on YouTube. The first from Content Folks, where my colleague [Josie Linsel](https://twitter.com/josielinsel) and I spoke about [the accessibility pros and cons of icons](https://youtu.be/o5RmhzxudZU), and the second from [Technica11y](https://technica11y.org) where [I spoke about the `<section>` element](https://youtu.be/6YwUniqUJSM). I also did some writing!

1. [How I approach CSS: my ABC system](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-i-approach-css-my-abc-system)
2. [What if no-one's listening?](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/what-if-no-ones-listening)
3. [iOS 15, Face ID, sunglasses, and Apple Watch](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/ios-15-face-id-sunglasses-and-apple-watch)
4. [A week with iOS 15](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/a-week-with-ios-15)
5. [Links, missing href attributes, and over-engineered code](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/links-missing-href-attributes-and-over-engineered-code)


## From the archives

My presentation at Technica11y was prompted by an article from the not-too-distant archives, back in February: [When and how to use the section element](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/when-and-how-to-use-the-section-element). It's a nice rundown of landmarks, what they do, how to use them, and what exactly the section element is for.


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I enjoyed during September:

- [The Purple Pound](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000x6wk) from the BBC Radio 4 show The Bottom Line
- [Accessibility testing](https://adactio.com/journal/18458) â€“ about finding issues at the right time
- [An update on the accessibility of conditionally revealed questions](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2021/09/21/an-update-on-the-accessibility-of-conditionally-revealed-questions/) from the GOV.UK team
- [Beware False Negatives](https://adrianroselli.com/2021/09/beware-false-negatives.html) â€“ why HTML validation is a vital and separate step to automated accessibility testing with tools like axe
- [Access Guide](https://www.accessguide.io/) â€“ a friendly intro to accessibility

Anyway, no talks scheduled for broadcast for a while, so I can get my head down with some more writing for you! See you in a month's time ðŸ‘‹
