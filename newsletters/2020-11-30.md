# üß¢ It‚Äôs Blue Beanie Day! November‚Äôs roundup

Being Scottish, I should probably be shouting about St. Andrew‚Äôs day, but web standards are too important, so Blue Beanie Day gets all my support! To find out more, check out [the article I wrote 8 years ago today](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/blue-beanie-day); more targeted at website owners (my clients at the time), but still a decent read. Aside from that blast from the past, I wrote four posts for you this month:

2. [Moving to Apple One with existing Apple subscriptions](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/moving-to-apple-one-with-existing-apple-subscriptions)
