# ðŸ‘¾ Star Wars Dayâ€™s nearly here! - Aprilâ€™s roundup from tempertemper

April kicked off with April Fool's Day, and the Easter weekend quickly followed, but my favourite day at this time of year is always May the 4th (Star Wars Day!). I'm a bit of a Star Wars geek and next Thursday is always a great excuse to sit down with the kids and watch one of the original three movies.

April wasn't all about playing tricks and eating chocolate though; I did manage to write a couple of blog articles for you too!

1. [VoiceOverâ€™s Trackpad Commander on Mac](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/voiceovers-trackpad-commander-on-mac)
2. [Getting VoiceOver to shut up](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/getting-voiceover-to-shut-up)


## From the archives

Since we're having a bit of a VoiceOver month, here's the first tutorial-style post I wrote on the subject: [Getting started with VoiceOver on macOS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/getting-started-with-voiceover-on-macos)


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during March:

- [WebAIM Million results for 2023](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)
- [What is Semantic HTML?](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/what-is-semantic-html/)
- [Designing for Reduced Motion](https://craftcms.com/blog/designing-for-reduced-motion)
- [This is what it looks like to be colorblind](https://www.theverge.com/23650428/colorblindness-design-ui-accessibility-wordle)
- '[It's very likely thatâ€¦](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/its-very-likely-1/)', a series of super short blog posts about common accessibility mistakes

Anyway, look out for my Star Wars Day avatar on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper) and I'll see you again at the end of May ðŸ›¸
