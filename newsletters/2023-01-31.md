# ü§ù Happy new year ‚Äì January‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

A busy start to the new year as we're finally approaching the end of a five year home renovation project. I'd've liked to have written more, but managed one post for you: [If you need a link, don‚Äôt use a button](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-you-need-a-link-dont-use-a-button).


## From the archives

I was chatting to some colleagues today about focus styling. We've been working on meeting the up-coming [Focus Appearance rules in WCAG 2.2](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-appearance-explained), but the conversation got extra interesting when discussing [more elegant focus styling using `:focus-visible`](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/refining-focus-styles-with-focus-visible). Worth another look; especially as `:focus-visible` has [full (and now well established) browser support](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/safari-focus-visible-and-accessibility).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during January:

- ['Forms, but better' series of 1-minute-ish videos](https://www.youtube.com/@adambsilver)
- [Screen Readers support for text level HTML semantics](https://www.tpgi.com/screen-readers-support-for-text-level-html-semantics/)
- [What we learned from our first accessibility conformance review](https://www.sanity.io/blog/sanity-accessibility-conformance-review)
- [Hello PDF, goodbye accessibility](https://uxdesign.cc/hello-pdf-goodbye-accessibility-6baa31e78972)
- [Eleventy v2.0.0 is in beta!](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1)

Anyway, I need to get back to the DIY ‚Äì that bannister won't sand itself! Catch you again at the end of January ü™ö
