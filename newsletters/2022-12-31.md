# üéä It‚Äôs Hogmanay! ‚Äì December‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

2022 is nearly over, and what a year‚Ä¶ again! Amongst the uncertainty at least one thing is still constant: I've written a couple of articles for you!

1. [Images, illustrations, and contrast](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/images-illustrations-and-contrast)
2. [Overlapping interactive areas](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/overlapping-interactive-areas)


## From the archives

I've been doing a lot of thinking about tables this month (brace yourself for at least one blog post on the subject during January!), so I thought it'd be worth pointing you to something I put together on how to ensure [tables that need to scroll horizontally on more constrained viewports are accessible](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessible-responsive-tables).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during December:

- [‚ÄòThe Greatest‚Äô; a video from Apple](https://youtu.be/c2UF26YpPFg)
- [Which airline apps fail blind people?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUfM2IeZp54)
- [Making the GOV.UK Frontend typography scale more accessible](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/12/12/making-the-gov-uk-frontend-typography-scale-more-accessible/)
- [The anatomy of visually-hidden](https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/)
- [Giphy is adding alt text to make GIFs more accessible](https://www.engadget.com/giphy-alt-text-gifs-screen-readers-accessibility-scribely-184931525.html)

Anyway, you've probably got more pressing things to do tonight, so here's to a positive and peaceful 2023 and I'll see you at the end of January üçª
