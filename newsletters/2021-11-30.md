# üéÑ The festive season is here ‚Äì November's roundup

I think I might have broken an unwritten rule as we picked up our Christmas tree today and it's not December until tomorrow‚Ä¶ What else have I been up to this month? I've written two articles:

1. [What do we do with a link or button matters](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/what-do-we-do-with-a-link-or-button-matters)
2. [An update on Google and the open web](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/an-update-on-google-and-the-open-web)


## From the archives

A post I wrote a while back came in useful for a colleague this month, so I thought to share it with you too: [Text snippets on Apple devices](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/text-snippets-on-apple-devices).


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I enjoyed during the month of November:

- [Hocus :focus](https://focus.hteumeuleu.com/), a Halloween styled game to give us an appreciation of the "horrors" that people who use only the keyboard have to endure every day
- [Rose Ayling-Ellis Moves Strictly Viewers To Tears With Emotional Performance Dedicated To The Deaf Community](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/strictly-come-dancing-rose-ailing-ellis-couples-choice-performance-deaf-community_uk_61901c4ae4b0c621c5cdbfb6)
- [Switch Role Support](https://adrianroselli.com/2021/10/switch-role-support.html) ‚Äì a detailed look into using `role="switch"`, which actually turns out to be a lesson in why we should test on multiple browsers on multiple devices
- [What Are Accessible Fonts?](https://www.accessibility.com/blog/what-are-accessible-fonts)

Anyway, I've got a tree to decorate, and the kids' advent calendars to prepare for tomorrow morning üéÖüèª See you this time next month for the last newsletter of 2021!
