## From the archives

At WWDC, Apple announced that CSS `aspect-ratio` will be coming to Safari later this year, which reminded me that [adding unitless dimensions to images in our HTML](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-image-aspect-ratios-to-avoiding-janky-page-loading) sets the aspect ratio before the image is fetched. A great way to stop that nasty jankiness as the page loads.


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting nuggets from around the web that I enjoyed during June:

- [Cognitive Bias and the Design Process](https://jonyablonski.com/articles/2021/cognitive-bias-and-the-design-process/)
- [Best Practices for Image Text Alternatives](https://knowbility.org/blog/2021/best-practices-for-image-text-alternatives)
- [The right tag for the job: why you should use semantic HTML](https://localghost.dev/2021/06/the-right-tag-for-the-job-why-you-should-use-semantic-html/)
- [At WWDC 2021, Apple Showed Yet Again Accessibility Truly Is For Everyone in Many Marquee Features](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2021/06/09/at-wwdc-2021-apple-showed-yet-again-accessibility-truly-is-for-everyone-in-many-marquee-features/)
- [Testing fonts for accessibility](https://uxdesign.cc/testing-fonts-for-accessibility-817f47011078)
- [The perfect link](https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/the-perfect-link/)
- [Your Image Is Probably Not Decorative](https://smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/img-alt-attribute-alternate-description-decorative/)

Anyway, I've got a some nice posts up my sleeve for July, and I've been doing some yet-to-be-published work on my website's visual presentation, so expect a write up on that. See you again this time next month üòé
