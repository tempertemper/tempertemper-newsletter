# ðŸ¦  Colds and Covid â€“ Marchâ€™s roundup

March began with a nasty cold that one of the kids brought home; then, after two very careful years, I caught COVID-19. Luckily, it didn't hit me as hard as it has some others, but flu isn't fun; even at the best of times. I still managed to get a few articles written for you though!

1. [Safari 15.4](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/safari-15-4)
2. [Is â€˜a11yâ€™ exclusive?](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/is-a11y-exclusive)

## From the archives

Someone [tweeted me the other day](https://twitter.com/vickystar2104/status/1508412768164192259) in reference to an article I'd written a while back about HTML's break (`<br />`) tag:

> I wish everyone was this sensible! When relying on screen readers, the breaks are painfully annoying. I am almost never reading poetry soâ€¦ ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜‚

This has featured in 'From the archives' before, around this time last year, but I thought to dig it out again as it's a decent read: [The right way to use break tags in HTML](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-right-way-to-use-break-tags-in-html).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles from around the web that I read during March:

- [Partially supported is not supported](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/partially-supported-is-not-supported)
- [A Tangled Web of ARIA](https://dev.to/steady5063/a-tangled-web-of-aria-50nk)
- [A comprehensive guide for how to be accessible on social media](https://www.accessible-social.com/)
- [Do virtual whiteboard apps work for everyone?](https://www.getstark.co/blog/do-virtual-whiteboard-apps-work-for-everyone)
- [Write plain text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext)

Anyway, I hope you manage to stay virus free, and I'll see you again this time next month ðŸ˜Š
