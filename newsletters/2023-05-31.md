# üó£Ô∏è Global Accessibility Awareness Day ‚Äì May‚Äôs roundup from tempertemper

May the 18th was Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) 2023, a day where accessibility geeks like me make a big old fuss about designing and building things in the right way. I marked GAAD by organising a whole day of talks and workshops for my colleagues at [Sage](https://www.sage.com/en-gb/) to dial into, and it was *great*. I also managed to write an article: [Don't meddle with user input](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/dont-meddle-with-user-input).


## From the archives

As part of GAAD, I gave a presentation on why WCAG (the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) level AA isn't the target for accessibility; it's the *baseline*. Here are the articles the presentation drew from:

- [Accessibility doesn‚Äôt stop at WCAG compliance](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessibility-doesnt-stop-at-wcag-compliance)
- [Bag some AAA wins where you can](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/bag-some-aaa-wins-where-you-can)


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during May:

- [Inaccessible PDFs? How to know when to use HTML webpages instead of PDFs](https://blog.pope.tech/2023/05/01/inaccessible-pdfs-how-to-know-when-to-use-html-webpages-instead-of-pdfs/)
- [Apple previews Live Speech, Personal Voice, and more new accessibility features](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/)
- [The problem with disabled buttons and what to do instead](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-disabled-buttons-and-what-to-do-instead/)
- [Semantic HTML and Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSNUi7pRmWg)
- [Designing for Dyslexia](https://medium.com/branding101/designing-for-dyslexia-9e61945f82b0)

Anyway, no conferences to arrange this month so I'll get back to my writing and see you again on the 30th of June! ‚úçÔ∏è
