# üå± Spring is here ‚Äì March newsletter

March is nearly over, the sun is no longer a distant memory, and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. Things are looking up!


## This month's posts
 
A bit of a mixed bag of posts this month, covering accessibility, Git and even a ‚ÄòUser manual‚Äô for me, in case you‚Äôre interested in what makes me tick:

1. [Why I stopped using ASCII art](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/why-i-stopped-using-ascii-art)
2. [Updating Netlify deployments when renaming your main Git branch](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/updating-netlify-deployments-when-renaming-your-main-git-branch)
3. [On not setting an upstream for short-lived branches](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/on-not-setting-an-upstream-for-short-lived-branches)
4. [My user manual](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/my-user-manual)
5. [Reset to a previous commit](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/reset-to-a-previous-commit)
6. [Sentence case versus title case](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/sentence-case-versus-title-case)


## From the archives

As Apple's WWDC approaches, there's always a bit of noise from tech journalists on where the company could improve their products. Something that caught my eye was from Daring Fireball, covering [how Apple Mail could better protect its users' privacy](https://daringfireball.net/2021/02/apple_mail_and_hidden_tracking_images). It reminded me of a short post I published last year on [how I look after my readers' privacy](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/respecting-peoples-privacy).


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some great videos and articles from around the web that I read during March:

- [Writing Good Alt Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flf2vS0IoRs)
- [prefers-reduced-motion: Taking a no-motion-first approach to animations](https://tatianamac.com/posts/prefers-reduced-motion/)

- [What Is It Like to Use a Screen Reader?](https://knowbility.org/blog/2021/what-is-it-like-to-use-a-screen-reader)
- [HTML Inputs and Labels: A Love Story](https://css-tricks.com/html-inputs-and-labels-a-love-story/)

Anyway, I hope the Easter Bunny brings you all the chocolate you can eat, and I'll catch up with you again at the end of April! üê∞üç´
