# 💀 Happy Halloween – October’s roundup from tempertemper

I’m just back from a fun evening trick-or-treating with the kids (or should I say Pikachu and Thing 1 from The Cat in the Hat) so, before I hit the sack, I thought to let you know that I wrote an article for you: [Accessibility by degrees](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessibility-by-degrees).


## From the archives

We all make mistakes, so here’s one I shared earlier this year so that you don’t cause the same problems for keyboard-only Windows High Contrast mode users that I did: [Windows High Contrast mode and focus outlines or: My focus indicators were inaccessible](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/windows-high-contrast-mode-and-focus-outlines).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I read during October:

- [WCAG 2.2 is a ‘W3C Recommendation’ web standard!](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/)
- [Ensuring negative numbers are available for everyone](https://www.deque.com/blog/ensuring-negative-numbers-are-available-for-everyone/)
- Introduction to screen‐readers, by Adam Liptrot:
    - [Voiceover MacOS](https://liptrot.org/guides/vo-macos/)
    - [NVDA](https://liptrot.org/guides/nvda)
    - [JAWS](https://liptrot.org/guides/jaws)
- [Don’t Use Fixed CSS height or width on Buttons, Links, or Any Other Text Containers](https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/don-t-use-fixed-css-height-or-width-on-text-containers)
- [How To Make A Strong Case For Accessibility](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/articles/accessibility-strong-case/)

Anyway, Halloween’s over and so is October, so I’m off to bed. Catch you again at the end of November! 🎃
