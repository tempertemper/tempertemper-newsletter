# üèñ Some end-of-summer downtime ‚Äì August‚Äôs roundup

I took a wee bit of time off during August, so just a single post for you this month, but one well worth reading if you're looking to make your website load faster and score some points with search engines along the way: [Critical CSS: what it is, why it‚Äôs useful, and how it works](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/critical-css-what-it-is-why-its-useful-and-how-it-works).


## From the archives

One of the most popular articles I wrote last year was [When design breaks semantics](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/when-design-breaks-semantics). Semantic HTML is great, but sometimes following the rules is tricky, like when a link has to look like a button in order to be easily understood by users. What seems like an easy switch can cause some real accessibility issues, but there are some neat ways to mitigate those.


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting articles I enjoyed during August:

- [A guide to designing accessible, WCAG-compliant focus indicators](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/focus-indicators/)
- [Colorblind Accessibility Manifesto](https://colorblindaccessibilitymanifesto.com/)
- [A Deep Dive on Skipping to Content](https://css-tricks.com/a-deep-dive-on-skipping-to-content/)
- [Building a resilient frontend using progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement)
- [UX=Accessibility & Accessibility=UX](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-accessibility-accessibility-ux-3f609617c480)

Anyway, have a great September, enjoy the reading, and I'll catch up with you again at the same time next month üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
