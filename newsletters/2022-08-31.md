# 💪 Hard fought – August’s roundup from tempertemper

Some articles take longer to write than others. I only published one in August but it was a long time in the making! I began writing it in March 2021, and it has gone through rewrite after rewrite; draft after draft. Well, I'm relieved to say it's *finally* ready to share: [Here, here, and here](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/here-here-and-here).


## From the archives

Something else that took a while to write and get right was a deliberately oversimplified summary of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I started with version 2.1 level AA, but quickly added two more articles covering level AAA and version 2.2:

- [WCAG, but in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand)
- [WCAG AAA in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-aaa-in-language-i-can-understand)
- [WCAG 2.2 in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-2-2-in-language-i-can-understand)


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some more interesting articles and videos from around the web that I read during August:

- [Ad Hoc's 'Accessibility Beyond Compliance' Playbook](https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/)
- [Perceived affordances and the functionality mismatch](https://tink.uk/perceived-affordances-and-the-functionality-mismatch/) or 'if it looks like a duck, it should quack like a duck'
- [Keyboard shortcuts need modifier keys](https://hidde.blog/keyboard-shortcuts/)
- [AI-Generated Images from AI-Generated Alt Text](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/08/ai-generated-images-from-ai-generated-alt-text.html) – insight into why images' descriptive text should be always be written by a human being
- [Underengineer Your Websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKDn-Q4zRPg), a great discussion around keeping things simple

Anyway, remember that things are sometimes more effort than expected, but it's usually worth it in the end! See you again at the end of September 🏋
