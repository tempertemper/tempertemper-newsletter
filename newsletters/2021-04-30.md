# 👨🏻‍🍳 Cooking with gas* – April's roundup

It has been a good, productive month: our new kitchen is finally finished, and I wrote six blog posts and have four or five solid drafts in the works.

<i>* Actually, we got an induction hob, so strictly speaking, we're cooking without gas</i> 😄


## This month's posts
 
I've thinking a lot about ‘text-level semantics’ like bold, italics and strikethrough, and how they work with screen readers. Over April I’ve also been playing with some newer Git commands:

1. [Bold and italics aren’t read by screen readers](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/bold-and-italics-arent-read-by-screen-readers)
2. [Cleaner focus outlines with box-decoration-break](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/cleaner-focus-outlines-with-box-decoration-break)
3. [Using Git switch to change branches](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-git-switch-to-change-branches)
4. [Git restore to discard changes](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/git-restore-to-discard-changes)
5. [The difference between strikethrough and del](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-difference-between-strikethrough-and-del)
6. [Be careful with strikethrough](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/be-careful-with-strikethrough)


## From the archives

The other day, I was looking at some HTML with a colleague and we were tutting in unison at the (mis)use of some `<br />` tags. It reminded me I’d written something on that subject last summer: [The right way to use break tags in HTML](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-right-way-to-use-break-tags-in-html).


## Elsewhere on the web

In no particular order, here are some interesting bits and bobs from around the web that I enjoyed during April:

- [About Legibility and Readability](https://medium.com/the-readability-group/about-legibility-and-readability-596fcd432a06)
- [A screen reader-accessible mini crossword from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini)
- [Inclusive teaching: audio describing your own presentations](https://feather.ca/inclusion/describing/)
- [The harmful ableist language you unknowingly use](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210330-the-harmful-ableist-language-you-unknowingly-use)
- [Add punctuation to your alt text](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/add-punctuation-to-your-alt-text)
- [Simple things are complicated: making a show password option](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/19/simple-things-are-complicated-making-a-show-password-option/)

Anyway, enjoy this month's reading and I'll see you again this time next month 👋
